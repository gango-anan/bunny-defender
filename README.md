# Bunny Defender
## About
Bunny Defender is a RPG Game designed using Phaser, HTML, JavaScript, and a API to store the game scores on a remote server. It's a game based on a farmer protecting his bunnies from being hunted down by hunters(space rocks). The Farmer(game player) keeps shooting down the space rocks pelted by the hunters to try and prevent them from hitting his bunnies. Once a rock hits a bunny it dies, it's ghost ascends upwards back to its creator and that bunny is lost forever to the hunter. Each time the farmer(player)successfully intercepts a space rock, the player gets 5 points which are accumulated as the game carries on till the end. 
At the end of the game the players scores along with the user name are save on the remote server.
A player can always check on the Leaders Board to see how he/she is fairing.
